Hi, I’m Michele, a university student and watch enthusiast. I've been interested in watches for a long time, and in 2022 I decided to start my collecting journey with a humble yet reliable Seiko 5 Sports. While living in Milan, I would always find an excuse to visit antique markets on Sunday mornings, hunting for vintage watches, which led to me adding a 50s Zenith Pilot to my collection. What excites me most about a watch is the story that comes with it, which is why I naturally gravitate towards vintage pieces. Recently, I had the pleasure of purchasing a Tudor Black Bay Fifty-Eight — a watch I had aspired to own for over a year. The next step I hope to take in the watch world is learning how to service and repair timepieces, in the meantime I decided to start this newsletter where I will be posting weekly article on the watches that interest me the most.
